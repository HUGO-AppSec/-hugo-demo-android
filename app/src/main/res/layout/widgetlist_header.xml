<!-- this shows a section title like "today" "tomorrow" or "later" for the big widget,
when notes are ordered by due date. If you write this layout in an incompatible way (android
widgets are picky about it), then an OS-provided view showing "Loading..." (or "Caricamento..."
or whatever) will appear instead. This layout is similar to android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1,
so you can use one of those in ListWidgetService.ListRemoteViewsFactory.getViewAt()
but I think that having it here lets us create a prettier style.
As of now it's aligned in the center, not on the left. That's just personal preference.
